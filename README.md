# CS-171-Lab-10
## Repo for lab 10 for ben

Hey Ben. I was, and am, very heavily medicated for pain so I didn't read the "We've provided you the code".

I hope I haven't made more work for you than is required.

Also, I understand that doing this without leveraging understanding of the APIs is kind of a given. I wouldn't store the arrays in a primitive array in Java. I'm not sure which data structure is best for this, there may be an ideal Collection type. Java is not my fort√©

The Lab10 class file will run the lot.
